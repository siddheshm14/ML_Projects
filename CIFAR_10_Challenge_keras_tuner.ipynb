        "In this lab you will experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture/design you'd like on [CIFAR-10 image dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). \n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 1: Creating the network (50% of grade)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal:** After training, your model should achieve **at least 80%** accuracy on a **validation** set within 20 epochs. (Or as close as possible as long as there is demonstrated effort to achieve this goal.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data split** The training set should consist of 40000 images, the validation set should consist of 10000 images, and the test set should consist of the remaining 10000 images. **Please use the Keras `load_data()` function to import the data set.**\n",

        "**Implementation** All code should be in Keras/python. \n",

        "- Different number/type of layers\n",
        "- Different filter sizes \n",
        "- Adjust the number of filters used in any given layer\n",
        "- Try various pooling strategies\n",
        "- Consider using batch normalization\n",
        "- Explore different numbers of layers in your network\n",
        "- Check if adding regularization helps\n",

        "When building/tuning your model, keep in mind the following points: \n",
        "\n",
        "- This is experimental, so be driven by results achieved on the validation set as opposed to what you have heard/read works well or doesn't\n",
        "- If the hyperparameters are working well, you should see improvement in the loss/accuracy within a few hundred iterations (usually within one epoch)\n",
        "- For hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all\n",
        "- Once you have found some sets of hyperparameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
        "- Prefer one validation to to cross-validation \n",
        "- Prefer random search to grid search for hyperparameters\n",
        "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search and for evaluating different architectures\n",
        "- The test set should only be used at the very end to evaluate your final model\n",
        "\n",
        "### What to provide\n",
        "\n",
        "The cell below should contain all the code necessary to run your final network on the cifar10 dataset as contained within Keras. All necessary hyperparameters should be visible either in the code or through comments. Your code should include 2 plots: one for training and validation loss per epoch and one for training and validation accuracy per epoch.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Your network should produce an accuracy of at least 80% on the validation set within 20 epochs. (Or as close as possible as long as there is demonstrated effort to achieve this goal.)\n",
        "\n",
        "You should also evaluate and report the accuracy on the test set. The test set should be used only once. That is, after you have decided on what to include in your network and tuned any hyperparameters for your final network, you should use this final network on the test set and calculate the accuracy.  \n",
